🚀 Day 28 of #100DaysOfDevOps with KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was all about Git Cherry-Pick 🌱

Here’s how I did it:
🔹 Checked the commit hash from the feature branch using git log
🔹 Switched to the master branch and applied the commit with:
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

💡 Key Takeaways:
🔹 git cherry-pick is a powerful command that allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another.
🔹 Conflicts can occur if changes clash. Git will pause and let you resolve them. Once fixed, use:
git cherry-pick --continue
🔹 Useful advanced options:
🔸 git cherry-pick --no-commit <commit-hash> → applies changes without creating a commit
🔸 git cherry-pick --edit <commit-hash> → edit the commit message before committing

⚠️ Cherry-picking is very useful, but should be used carefully—especially on public branches—to avoid duplicate commits with different hashes.

🔥 Learn daily, build consistently!
