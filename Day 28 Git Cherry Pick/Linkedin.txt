Today's challenge was all about Git Cherry Pick

Here’s how I did it: 

🔹 Checked the commit hash from the feature branch using: git log
🔹 Switched to the master branch and applied the commit:
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

💡 Key Takeaways:

🔹 git cherry-pick is a powerful command that lets you apply a specific commit from one branch to another.
🔹 Conflicts may occur if the new changes clash with the current branch, Git will pause and alert you to resolve them. Once resolved, add your changes and continue using: git cherry-pick --continue
🔹Some useful advanced options:
🔸 git cherry-pick --no-commit <commit-hash> : applies the change without creating a new commit
🔸 git cherry-pick --edit <commit-hash> : lets you edit the commit message before committing

⚠️ While cherry-picking is handy, use it with caution , especially between public branches, as it can lead to duplicate commits with different hashes.

Keep learning, keep building!
