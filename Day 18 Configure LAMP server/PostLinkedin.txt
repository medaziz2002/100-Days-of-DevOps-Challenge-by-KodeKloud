🚀 Day 18 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was all about configuring a LAMP server. The lab handled most of the setup, so I focused mainly on the database part.

Here’s what I did:

🔹 Installed MariaDB
🔹 Accessed it as the root user
🔹 Created a new database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE kodekloud_db3;
```

🔹 Created a new user (example with placeholders to understand the syntax):

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a new user
CREATE USER 'username_here'@'host_here' IDENTIFIED BY 'password_here';

-- Example:
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'MySecretPass123';
```

🔹 Granted full access to the user on the database:

```sql
-- Step 2: Grant privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'username_here'@'host_here';

-- Example:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kodekloud_db3.* TO 'myuser'@'%';
```

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Common MariaDB commands:
🔸 Show all databases: `SHOW DATABASES;`
🔸 List users: `SELECT User FROM mysql.user;`
🔸 Delete a user: `DROP USER 'myuser'@'%';`
🔸 View user privileges: `SHOW GRANTS FOR 'myuser'@'%';`

✅ In MariaDB, `%` is a wildcard for hostnames, meaning the user can connect from **any host**.
✅ Just like in PostgreSQL, (`"`) and (`'`) are different, and every command must end with a semicolon `;`!

Yesterday we explored PostgreSQL, and today we took our first steps with MariaDB. We barely scratched the surface, but understanding the basics is essential.

Keep learning and keep coding! 💻✨
