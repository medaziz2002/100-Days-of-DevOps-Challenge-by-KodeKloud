🚀 Day 29 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today's challenge was all about merging Git Pull Requests (PRs).

Here’s how I did it:
🔹 Created a new feature branch and opened a Pull Request
🔹 Added a reviewer to the PR
🔹 Switched roles to the reviewer, reviewed the code, and merged the PR
🔹 The diagram below explains it all in more detail 👇

💡 Key Takeaways:

🔹 A Pull Request (PR) is used to propose changes from one branch to another — enabling collaboration and code review before merging.
🔹 Using PRs is an everyday task, and practicing it helps much more than just reading about it.

Keep learning and pushing your limits! 🚀
