Day2:Temporary User Setup with expiry
Task:
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named yousuf requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:
Create a user named yousuf on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-01-28, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.


Here’s how I did it:
useradd yousuf -e 2024-01-28
-e: Set the account expiration date.

📌 Recommendation
Most admins (and documentation) use this format:
sudo useradd -e 2024-01-28 yousuf
because options usually come before the username.
But again — both are technically valid and correct.
