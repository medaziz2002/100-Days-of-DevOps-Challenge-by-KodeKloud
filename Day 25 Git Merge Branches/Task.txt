The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/beta.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:
Create a new branch devops in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.




cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta

# create and switch to devops branch from master
git checkout master
git checkout -b devops

# copy the file
cp /tmp/index.html .

# add and commit in devops branch
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add index.html"

# push devops branch to origin
git push origin devops

# switch back to master and merge
git checkout master
git merge devops

# push master branch to origin
git push origin master
