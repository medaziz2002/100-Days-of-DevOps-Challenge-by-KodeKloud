🚀 Day 25 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was all about merging Git branches 🧩

Here’s how I tackled it:
🔹 Created a new branch from master
🔹 Added and committed a new file on that branch
🔹 Switched back to master and merged the branch using git merge

💡 Key takeaways:

✅ When you run git merge <branch>, the current branch (e.g. master) receives the changes, while the other branch remains unchanged
✅ Consistency beats speed — learning step by step really pays off 🚀

More challenges coming next — stay tuned! 👀✨
