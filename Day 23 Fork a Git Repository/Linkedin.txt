🚀 Day 23 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was all about Forking a Git Repository

Here’s what I did:
🔹 This time, no terminal was required
🔹 I explored the repository directly on GitHub
🔹 With just one click on the Fork button, I created my own copy of the project

💡 Key Takeaways:

✅ Forking allows you to create an independent copy of a repository under your own GitHub account
✅ It’s a great way to contribute to open-source projects or safely experiment with code
✅ Even small tasks play a big role in building strong fundamentals

📹 As mentioned in the note, I also recorded a short video to demonstrate how I completed this task, following the required web UI guidelines.

👉 Wishing everyone a productive Monday! 🚀
