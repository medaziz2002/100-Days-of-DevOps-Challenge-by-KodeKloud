🚀 Day 24 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was all about creating Git branches.

Here’s how I did it:

🔹 What I practiced today:

🔹 Listed all existing branches: git branch

🔹 Switched back to the main branch: git switch master

🔹 Created a new working branch: git branch new_branch

💡 Key Takeaways:

✅ A Git branch represents an independent line of development, making it easier to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch.

✅ Other useful Git commands:

🔻 git checkout -b new_branch : create and switch to a new branch in one step

🔻 git branch -d new_branch : delete a branch that is no longer needed

On to the next task 🚀
