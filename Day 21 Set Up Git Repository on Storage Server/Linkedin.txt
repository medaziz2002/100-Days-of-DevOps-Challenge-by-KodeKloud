🚀 Day 21 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today's challenge was all about Setting up a Git Repository on a Server – a fundamental skill for any DevOps engineer!

Here’s how I did it:
🔹 Installed Git on the server: sudo yum install git -y
🔹 Created the repository directory at /opt/ecommerce.git and navigated to it
🔹 Initialized a bare repository: git init --bare

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ A bare repository has no working directory – you can't commit directly to it, only push to it from local repositories
✅ Perfect for use as a central repository where multiple developers can collaborate by pushing and pulling changes
✅ Always use --bare (double dashes) when initializing – a small detail that makes a big difference!

On to Day 22! 💪
