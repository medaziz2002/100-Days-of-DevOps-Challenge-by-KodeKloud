# ✅ **Task: Copy an Encrypted File From the Docker Host to the `ubuntu_latest` Container**

The Nautilus DevOps team stores confidential data on **App Server 1** in the Stratos Datacenter. A container named **`ubuntu_latest`** is running on the same server.

The goal is to **copy an encrypted file**:

* **Source on host:** `/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg`
* **Destination inside container:** `/tmp/`
* The file must **not be modified** during the operation.

The correct tool for this is `docker cp`, which copies files **exactly as they are**.

# 📌 **Steps and Commands Executed (Organized Version)**

### 🔹 1. Check the running container

```bash
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
d422066717b5   ubuntu    "/bin/bash"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes             ubuntu_latest
```

### 🔹 2. Confirm the encrypted file exists on the host

```bash
[tony@stapp01 tmp]$ ls
nautilus.txt.gpg
systemd-private-...
```

➡️ The file **`nautilus.txt.gpg`** is present in `/tmp`.

---

### 🔹 3. Copy the file to the container

```bash
[tony@stapp01 /]$ docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/tmp/
Successfully copied 2.05kB to ubuntu_latest:/tmp/
```

➡️ The encrypted file has been copied **without any modification** into the container's `/tmp` directory.

---

# 🎉 **Final Result**

The encrypted file **`/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg`** has been successfully copied to:

```
ubuntu_latest:/tmp/
```

The operation completed safely and correctly.
