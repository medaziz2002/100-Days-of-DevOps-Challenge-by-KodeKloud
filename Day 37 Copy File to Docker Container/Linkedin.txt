Today’s challenge focused on copying files to a Docker container.

Here’s how I did it: 
🔹 Copy a file into a container: docker cp /tmp/fileToCopy <containerID>:/home/fileToCopy
🔹 Verify by entering the container: docker exec -it <containerID> /bin/bash

💡 Key Takeaways:

✅ You can also copy files from the container back to the host using the same docker cp command.
✅ The -it option in docker exec:
-i keeps STDIN open
-t allocates a pseudo-TTY
 Together, they allow an interactive session inside the container.

Have a great day, everyone!

Got it — here is **the same style of post**, but **ONLY using your exact task**, nothing extra.

Today’s challenge focused on copying an encrypted file into a Docker container.

Here’s how I did it: 
🔹 Copy the encrypted file from the Docker host to the container:
`docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/tmp/`

🔹 Verify by entering the container:
`docker exec -it ubuntu_latest /bin/bash`

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ `docker cp` lets you transfer files without modifying them.
✅ The `-it` option in `docker exec` gives you an interactive shell inside the container.

On to the next challenge! 🚀
