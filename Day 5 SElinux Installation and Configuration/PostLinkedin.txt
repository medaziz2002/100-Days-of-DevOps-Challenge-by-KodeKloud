Today’s challenge focused on SELinux Installation and Configuration. 

Here’s how I tackled it:
🔹 Installed the necessary packages:
sudo yum install selinux-policy-devel selinux-policy-doc selinux-policy-mls 
setroubleshoot-server setools-console mcstrans policycoreutils-python-utils 
policycoreutils-gui -y
🔹 Edited the configuration file /etc/sysconfig/selinux and set it to disabled (SELINUX=disabled)
 🔹 Verified SELinux status using sestatus and getenforce

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a robust security mechanism in the Linux kernel that enforces fine-grained access control policies.
 ✅ SELinux has three modes (/etc/selinux/config):
 🔺 Enforcing – actively enforces policies and blocks unauthorized access.
 🔺 Permissive – logs violations without enforcing them (ideal for testing).
 🔺 Disabled – turns SELinux off completely.

From theory to practice, mastering Linux security step by step! 🛠️
