Task:

Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter:
Install the required SELinux packages.
Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.
No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.
Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.

What is SELinux?
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux® systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system.


1️⃣ The command that didn’t work
sudo yum install selinux-policy-devel selinux-policy-doc selinux-policy-mls \
setroubleshoot-server setools-console mcstrans policycoreutils-python \
policycoreutils-gui

❌ Why it didn’t work

policycoreutils-python does not exist on your system (EL9 / RHEL 9 / Rocky 9 / AlmaLinux 9).

This package only existed on CentOS/RHEL 7.

On newer versions, the SELinux Python tools were moved to a new package:

Old OS	| Old package	|New OS	|New package
RHEL/CentOS 7|	policycoreutils-python|	RHEL/CentOS/Alma/Rocky 8+|	policycoreutils-python-utils

So yum cannot find policycoreutils-python → error: No match for argument: policycoreutils-python

2️⃣ The command that worked

sudo yum install selinux-policy-devel selinux-policy-doc selinux-policy-mls \
setroubleshoot-server setools-console mcstrans policycoreutils-python-utils \
policycoreutils-gui


sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/selinux
