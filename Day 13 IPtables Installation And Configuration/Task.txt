We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. 
Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apache’s port i.e 3001 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements: 
1. Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host. 
2. Block incoming port 3001 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host. 
3. Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.




LBR is a network Load Balancer or Load Balancer Router.

A load balancer is typically used in front of a pool of web or application servers to spread inbound traffic across several systems.



iptables 
iptables est un firewall programme pour lunix






command to check the distribution of these servers:


  cat /etc/os-release


It's useful for checking if a service is actually listening on port 5001 before you configure firewall rules

  $ ss -tlun | grep 500

| grep 500 - Filters the output to show only lines containing "500"

  ss -tlun : Shows network socket information with these options:

-t = Show TCP sockets only
-l = Listening = Server-side sockets that are WAITING for incoming connections
-u = Show UDP sockets only
-n = Show numeric addresses/ports (don't resolve hostnames



iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3001 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3001 -j DROP
