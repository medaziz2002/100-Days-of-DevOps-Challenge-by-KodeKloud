Today's challenge was all about Installing and Configuring Tomcat Server

Here's what I did:
🔹 Installed Tomcat on the app server
🔹 Updated server.xml to serve the app on port 5001
🔹 Copied the .war file from Jump Host using scp, then deployed it to Tomcat's webapps directory for deployment

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ A Connector represents an endpoint through which requests are received and responses are returned.
 ✅ We can have multiple connectors, but to change the port, we need to modify the one using the HTTP protocol.
 ✅ Deployment can also be done using Tomcat Manager or Maven.

Have a wonderful evening and good night! 🌙
