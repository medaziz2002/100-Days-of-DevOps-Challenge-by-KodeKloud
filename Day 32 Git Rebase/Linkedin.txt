Today's challenge was all about Git Rebase

Here’s how I did it: 
🔹 Switched to the feature branch: git checkout feature
🔹 Rebasing the feature branch on top of master: git rebase master
🔹 Instead of using --force when pushing, I used git pull --rebase to fetch and reapply my local commits on top of the latest remote changes ,keeping the history clean and avoiding conflicts: git pull --rebase origin feature
🔹 Finally, pushed the updated feature branch to the remote: git push origin feature

💡 Key Takeaways:

🔸 git rebase master replays your local commits on top of the master branch for a cleaner history.
 🔸 git pull --rebase fetches and rebases in one step — no merge commits, no messy history.
 🔸 Using git pull --rebase avoids the need for --force when pushing, reducing the risk of overwriting others’ work.
 🔸 Rebasing helps maintain a linear, easy-to-read Git history ; perfect for collaborative development!

Have a Great Day Everyone!
