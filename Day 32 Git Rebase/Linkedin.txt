🚀 Day 32 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today's challenge was all about Git Rebase

Here’s how I did it:
🔹 Switched to the feature branch: git checkout feature
🔹 Rebased the feature branch on top of master: git rebase master
🔹 Instead of using --force, I synced with the remote using rebase to reapply my commits on top of the latest changes:
    git pull --rebase origin feature
🔹 Pushed the updated feature branch to the remote: git push origin feature

💡 Key Takeaways:

🔸 git rebase master replays your local commits on top of the master branch for a clean, linear history
🔸 git pull --rebase fetches and rebases in one step — no merge commits, no messy logs
🔸 Avoiding --force helps protect teammates’ work and reduces the risk of conflicts
🔸 Rebasing makes project history easier to read and review — perfect for team collaboration

✨ On to the next challenge — let’s keep building and learning! ✨
