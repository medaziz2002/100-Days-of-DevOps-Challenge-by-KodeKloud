🚀 Day 15 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was all about setting up SSL with Nginx 🔐

Here’s what I worked on:
🔹 Installed Nginx
🔹 Explored /etc/nginx/nginx.conf to understand TLS configuration
🔹 Moved the provided certificate and key to the correct locations
🔹 Updated the index.html in Nginx’s root directory
🔹 Restarted Nginx to apply the changes

💡 Key Takeaways:

✅ SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) ensure secure communication between a web server and a client’s browser.
✅ Simple to set up, yet critical — encryption protects data and verifies the server’s identity (and optionally the client’s).

🔐 Securing applications is not optional, it’s essential. On to the next DevOps challenge! 🚀
