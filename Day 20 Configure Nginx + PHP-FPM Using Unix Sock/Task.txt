onfigure Nginx + PHP-FPM Using Unix Sock

Question
The Nautilus application development team is planning to launch a new PHP-based application, which they want to deploy on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The development team had a meeting with the production support team and they have shared some requirements regarding the infrastructure. Below are the requirements they shared:

a. Install nginx on app server 2 , configure it to use port 8094 and its document root should be /var/www/html.

b. Install php-fpm version 8.1 on app server 2, it must use the unix socket /var/run/php-fpm/default.sock (create the parent directories if don't exist).

c. Configure php-fpm and nginx to work together.

d. Once configured correctly, you can test the website using curl http://stapp02:8094/index.php command from jump host.

Solution
SSH to the app server requested - it may be a different app server for you.

ssh steve@stapp02
Become root to save typing sudo on every command

sudo -i
Install ngnix and php-fpm

dnf install -y nginx
dnf module -y install php:8.1/common
Configure php-fpm

Edit /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf with vi.
Edit the user = and group = lines to both use nginx instead of apache.
Edit the listen = line to refer the path to the socket given in the question.
Save and exit
Set directory permissions on php files to nginx group
chown -R root:nginx /var/lib/php
Configure nginx

Open /etc/nginx/nginx.conf in vi

Set given port number (which may be different for you)

Set given HTML directory

Set location block for PHP files.

The server configuration should look like this when completed

    server {
        listen       8094 default_server;
        listen       [::]:8094 default_server;
        server_name  _;
        root         /var/www/html;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        location / {
        }

        # Add this location configuration
        location ~ \.php$ {
            try_files $uri =404;
            fastcgi_pass php-fpm;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include fastcgi_params;
        }

        error_page 404 /404.html;
            location = /40x.html {
        }

        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
        }
    }
Configure php-fpm nginx module

Open /etc/nginx/conf.d/php-fpm.conf in vi
Edit the path to the socket to match that in the question
Restart services

systemctl restart php-fpm
systemctl restart nginx
curl test

curl http://stapp02:8094/index.php
Return to jump host and curl test from there

[steve@stapp02 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to stapp02 closed.
thor@jump_host ~$ curl http://stapp02:8094/index.php
