Today’s challenge was all about Installing Ansible

Here’s how I did it:
 🔹 sudo pip3 install Ansible==4.7.0

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies IT operations and works across multiple environments.
 ✅ Using sudo makes Ansible globally available on the system, not just for the current user.
 ✅ We use pip3 instead of yum because Ansible packages are no longer included in CentOS’s default yum repositories.

Making steady progress every day — even light tasks count!
Wishing everyone a productive and amazing weekend! 💪✨
