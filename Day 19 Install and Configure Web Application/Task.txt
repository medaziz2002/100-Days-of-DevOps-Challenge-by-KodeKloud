xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:


a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 2.
b. Apache should serve on port 6300.
c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/blog and /home/thor/games on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that blog should work on the link http://localhost:6300/blog/ and games should work on link http://localhost:6300/games/ on the mentioned app server.


d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:6300/blog/ and curl http://localhost:6300/games/


I logged into App Server 2 and performed the following steps to complete the task.

First, I installed the Apache (httpd) package along with its dependencies.
Then, I edited the Apache configuration file and changed the listening port to 6300.
After saving the changes, I restarted the Apache service to apply the new configuration.

Next, I copied the website backups blog and games from the jump_host to the app server.
I first copied both directories to the /tmp directory and then moved them to Apache’s document root /var/www/html.

Finally, I verified the configuration by accessing both websites using the curl command:
curl http://localhost:6300/blog/
curl http://localhost:6300/games/

Both websites were accessible successfully.
