Today’s challenge was all about installing and configuring PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database 🐘

🔹 Accessed the PostgreSQL CLI as the postgres user:
sudo -u postgres psql

🔹 Created a new user
🔹 Created a new database
🔹 Granted full privileges on the database to the user

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Useful PostgreSQL commands:

\du → list all users

\l → list all databases

\q → quit the PostgreSQL CLI

✅ Single quotes (' ') and double quotes (" ") have different meanings in PostgreSQL
✅ Never forget the semicolon (;) — one missing character can break everything!

PostgreSQL is a huge ecosystem, and this is just the beginning — but every small step counts 🚀
