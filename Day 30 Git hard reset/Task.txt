The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog present on Storage server in Stratos DC. This was just a test repository and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message add data.txt file. Find below more details:
In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file.
Also make sure to push your changes.


### Git Hard Reset Example
#### 1️⃣ Check commit history

```bash
git log
```
* Before reset: multiple recent commits (Test Commit1 → Test Commit10)
* HEAD points to `ec51510942c4d97ab801493d7a70addd9835e391` (Test Commit10)
---
#### 2️⃣ Reset local repository to an older commit
```bash
git reset --hard 9773ec0bbdde99409b5f83be99162793ed64e01a
```
* HEAD now points to commit: `add data.txt file`
* All commits after this one are **deleted locally**
* Index and working directory are reset to this commit's state
Verify:
```bash
git log
```
* Now shows only:
```
commit 9773ec0bbdde99409b5f83be99162793ed64e01a  (HEAD -> master)
commit 3b666d842437bfba1fd352c731d2efcb382fe0b4  (initial commit)
```
---
#### 3️⃣ Push changes to the remote repository
```bash
git push --force origin master
```
* ⚠️ `--force` is necessary because local history is **behind** the remote
* This rewrites the history on `origin/master` to match your local repository
---
✅ **Final result:**
* Local and remote repositories now point to commit `add data.txt file`
* All later commits (Test Commit1 → Test Commit10) are removed from the server
