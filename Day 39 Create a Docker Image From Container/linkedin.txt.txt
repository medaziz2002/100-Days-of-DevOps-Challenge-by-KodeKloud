🚀 Day 39 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today's challenge focused on Creating a Docker Image From a Container!

Here's how I tackled it:
🔹 SSHed into Application Server 3 and verified the running container ubuntu_latest using docker ps
🔹 Used the commit command: docker commit ubuntu_latest cluster:xfusion
🔹 Verified the newly created image using docker images — and there it was: cluster:xfusion ready to go! ✅

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ docker commit allows you to capture the current state of a running container and save it as a brand new Docker image — including all modifications made inside it.
✅ The format repository:tag (e.g., cluster:xfusion) keeps your images organized and versioned.
✅ The best part? The container keeps running during the commit — zero downtime! 🔥

Have a great day, everyone! 🦬
