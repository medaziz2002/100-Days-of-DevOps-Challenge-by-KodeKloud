🚀 Day 27 of hashtag#100DaysOfDevOps with hashtag#KodeKloud 🚀

Today's challenge was all about reverting changes in Git.

Here’s how I did it:
🔹 First, I checked the commit hash I wanted to revert using : git log
🔹 Then, I reverted the commit and returned the repo to the previous state with : git revert <commit_hash>

🗒️ Note:
🔹 Git cheat sheets have been super helpful in keeping track of commands and workflows. If you’re learning Git, make sure you have one handy!

Keep experimenting and learning! 💻✨
