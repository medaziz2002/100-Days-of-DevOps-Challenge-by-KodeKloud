🚀 Day 26 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was all about managing multiple Git remotes.

Here’s what I did:
🔹 Added a new remote pointing to another repo: git remote add dev_blog /opt/xfusioncorp_blog.git
🔹 Checked that the new remote was correctly added: git remote -v
🔹 Copied a new file into the repo, added it, and committed the changes
🔹 Pushed the master branch to the new remote: git push dev_blog master

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ A Git remote lets you connect your local repo with multiple remote repositories for easier collaboration.
✅ It’s super helpful for syncing code, backing up changes, and working in teams.

Let’s keep coding and learning every day! 🐮
