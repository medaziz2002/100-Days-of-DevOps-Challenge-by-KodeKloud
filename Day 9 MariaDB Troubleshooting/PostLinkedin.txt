Task:

There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.

Look into the issue and fix the same.


Here’s how I did it:

sudo ls -lah /var/lib/mysql
ls: cannot access '/var/lib/mysql': No such file or directory

sudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql

sudo ls -lah /var/lib/mysql
total 12K
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Sep  2 08:53 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4.0K Sep  2 08:53 ..

sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql

sudo ls -lah /var/lib/mysql
drwxr-xr-x 2 mysql mysql 4.0K Sep  2 08:53 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root  root  4.0K Sep  2 08:53 ..

sudo systemctl restart mariadb
sudo systemctl status mariadb
