🚀 Day 9 of hashtag#100DaysOfDevOps with hashtag#KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was all about MariaDB Troubleshooting🔧🐬

🔍 What happened?
When I ran:
sudo journalctl -xeu mariadb.service
I saw this error:
"Database MariaDB is not initialized, but the directory /var/lib/mysql is not empty, so initialization cannot be done."
But when I checked:
sudo ls -lah /var/lib/mysql
I got:
No such file or directory
So MariaDB couldn’t start because the data directory didn’t exist at all.

🔧 Here’s how I did it:
🔹 Created the missing data directory : sudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql
🔹 Verified it : sudo ls -lah /var/lib/mysql
🔹 Fixed its permissions by assigning it to the correct user (mysql) : 
 sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
🔹Restarted MariaDB — and it started successfully 🎉

💡 Key Takeaways
✅ Sometimes the issue is as simple as a missing directory
✅ MariaDB needs /var/lib/mysql to exist AND be owned by the mysql user
✅ -R in chown means “apply recursively to all subfolders and files”

🦬 That’s my Day 9 summary — simple fix, but a great learning moment!
