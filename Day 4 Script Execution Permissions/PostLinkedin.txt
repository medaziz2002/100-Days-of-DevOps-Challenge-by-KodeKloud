🚀 Day 4 of hashtag#100DaysOfDevOps with hashtag#KodeKloud 🚀
Today's challenge was all about Script Execution Permissions
Here's how I did it:
🔹 Used chmod a+rx /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh (with sudo privileges)
🔹 Alternatively, using symbolic format:

chmod u+rwx → adds read, write, and execute for the owner
chmod g+rx and chmod o+rx → give read and execute permissions to group and others

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ To make a file executable, the user or group must also have read permission — otherwise, it won't run.
✅ There are two ways to set permissions:

Numerical (e.g., 755 = rwxr-xr-x)
Symbolic (e.g., u+rwx, g+rx, o+rx)

📊 Quick reminder:

r (read) = 4
w (write) = 2
x (execute) = 1

Small steps, but steady progress! Each day brings new understanding of Linux fundamentals. 💪
