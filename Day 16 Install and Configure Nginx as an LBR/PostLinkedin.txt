Today's challenge focused on configuring Nginx as a Load Balancer🔄⚖️

Here's how I did it:
🔹 Installed Nginx on the LBR (Load Balancer) server
🔹 Set up proxy configuration in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf to forward traffic to backend servers on port 5003
🔹 Verified Apache/httpd was running on all app servers using systemctl status httpd and ss -tlnp | grep httpd
🔹 Tested the load balancer configuration and successfully accessed the application
💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck
✅ High availability isn't just about redundancy—it's about ensuring consistent performance under increasing load
✅ Always verify backend services are running before testing the load balancer!
🔐 Pro Tip: Checking service status with systemctl and port binding with ss or netstat should be your first debugging steps when troubleshooting connectivity issues.

Another day, another DevOps skill unlocked! 🚀
