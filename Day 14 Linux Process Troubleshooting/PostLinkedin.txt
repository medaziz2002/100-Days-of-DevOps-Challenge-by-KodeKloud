🚀 Day 14 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀
Today's Challenge was all about Linux Process Troubleshooting
Here's how I did it:
🔹 Logged in to the app01 server
🔹 Tried to start the Apache service, got an error: "Address already in use"
🔹 Checked which process was using the assigned port 8083 using: "ss -tunlp | grep 8083" and killed the conflicting process
🔹 Restarted the httpd service, it worked just fine.
💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Practice makes perfect. 😁
Keep learning, keep growing! 🚀💪
