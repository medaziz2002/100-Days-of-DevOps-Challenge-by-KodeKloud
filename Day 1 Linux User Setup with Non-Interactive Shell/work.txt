To accommodate the backup agent tool's specifications, the system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries requires the creation of a user with a non-interactive shell.
Task:
Create a user named ammar with a non-interactive shell on App Server 1.
Goal: Create a user named ammar that cannot log in interactively (non-interactive shell) on App Server 1.

Step 1: Access App Server 1:

You need to connect to the server. Usually, this is done using SSH (a secure way to access Linux servers).
The command looks like this:
ssh your_username@app_server_1_ip
your_username-> your admin or sudo user on the server.
app_server_1_ip → the IP address of App Server 1 (you get this from the "Details of all Users and Servers").

Step 2: Understand the “non-interactive shell”

Interactive vs non interactive shell:(src:https://notes.kodekloud.com/docs/Advanced-Bash-Scripting/Introduction/Interactive-vs-non-interactive-shell)

interactive shells are designed for on-the-fly command entry.==> this is the type of shell you normally use when you log in to a server or open a terminal on your computer.you type commands one by one, and the shell executes them immediately.

non-interactive shells execute prewritten scripts without user intervention.==>this shell runs scripts automatically, without waiting for yout input.useful for automation, like cron jobs ,deployment scripts , or startup scripts.


Step 3: Create the user
(src:https://notes.kodekloud.com/docs/Learning-Linux-Basics-Course-Labs/Security-and-File-Permissions/User-Management)
the command to create a user is:
sudo useradd -m -s /sbin/nologin ammar
sudo : run the command as admin (root)
useradd : Command to create a new user
-m : create a home directory for the user (optinal but recommended)
-s :sets the login shell for the user.
/sbin/nologin Set the shell to non-interactive (cannot log in) ===> cannot log in interactively to the terminal.
ammar : the name of the user

Step 4: Check if the user was created
Run this command:getent passwd ammar
