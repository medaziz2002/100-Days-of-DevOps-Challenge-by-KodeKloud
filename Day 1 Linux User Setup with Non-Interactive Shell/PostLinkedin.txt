Today’s challenge was all about setting up Linux users with a non-interactive shell.

Here’s how I did it:
useradd -m -s /sbin/nologin username

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Learned the difference between interactive and non-interactive shells :
non-interactive shells are used for scripts or cron jobs (no user input),
while interactive shells are for direct user commands.

✅ Understood the difference between useradd and adduser :
useradd is ideal for scripts, automation, and minimal setups,
while adduser is more interactive and applies default configurations.

✅ The -m option:
Creates the user's home directory automatically (e.g., /home/serviceuser)
Without -m, no home directory is created

✅ The -s option:
Defines the user's login shell (e.g., bash, zsh, or nologin)
Using /sbin/nologin creates a user who cannot log in interactively - perfect for system or service accounts.

It may look simple, but every journey starts with a small step. 🚀
