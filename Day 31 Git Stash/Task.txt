The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news present on Storage server in Stratos DC. One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository, but now they want to restore some of the stashed changes. Find below more details to accomplish this task:

Look for the stashed changes under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news git repository, and restore the stash with stash@{1} identifier. Further, commit and push your changes to the origin.



# 📦 Restore a Specific Git Stash and Push Changes

## 🎯 Objective

A developer previously stashed some in-progress changes in a Git repository and now wants to restore a specific stash (`stash@{1}`), commit those changes, and push them to the remote repository.

This guide explains how to:

* List available stashes
* Restore a specific stash
* Commit the restored changes
* Push them to the origin repository

---

## 📍 Environment

* **Repository Path:** `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news`
* **Remote Repository:** `/opt/news.git`
* **Branch:** `master`

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Check Commit History

Verify the current state of the branch:

```bash
git log
```

---

### 2. List Available Stashes

Display all stashed changes:

```bash
git stash list
```

Example output:

```
stash@{0}: WIP on master: bde60d7 initial commit
stash@{1}: WIP on master: bde60d7 initial commit
```

---

### 3. Apply the Required Stash

Restore the changes from `stash@{1}`:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

---

### 4. Verify Repository Status

Ensure the restored files are staged and ready to be committed:

```bash
git status
```

Expected output:

```
Changes to be committed:
  new file:   welcome.txt
```

---

### 5. Commit the Restored Changes

Create a commit for the applied stash:

```bash
git commit -m "Restore stash@{1}"
```

---

### 6. Push to Remote Repository

Push the commit to the `master` branch:

```bash
git push origin master
```

---

## 🎉 Result

* The changes from `stash@{1}` have been successfully restored
* A new commit has been created
* The updated `master` branch is pushed to the remote repository

---

## 📝 Notes & Best Practices

* `git stash apply` restores changes but keeps the stash in the stash list
* To restore and remove the stash at the same time, use:

```bash
git stash pop stash@{1}
```
