🚀 Day 22 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today’s challenge was cloning a local Git repository.

Here’s what I did:
🔹 Switched to the target user: sudo -i -u natasha
🔹 Went to the destination folder: cd /destination/path
🔹 Cloned the repo: git clone /source/path/ecommerce.git
🔹 Checked that the .git folder exists to confirm success ✅

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Cloning a local Git repo copies the repo with its full history.
✅ Using sudo -i -u username ensures correct permissions and environment, unlike sudo git clone.

Have a great day, everyone! 🌟
