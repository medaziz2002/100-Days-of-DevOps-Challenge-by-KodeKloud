🚀 Day 33 of #100DaysOfDevOps with #KodeKloud 🚀

Today's challenge was all about Resolving Git Merge Conflicts

Here’s how I did it:

🔹 Tried to push changes to the repository
🔹 Got error: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally"
🔹 Did a git pull to get the updates from the remote
🔹 Got message: "CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in story-index.txt"
🔹 Resolved the conflicts, then added, committed, and pushed the changes

💡 Key Takeaways:

✅ A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically reconcile differences between branches during a merge.

✅ Identify the files with conflicts by running git status. Conflicted files will be listed under Unmerged paths.

Merge conflicts solved, productivity unlocked! ⚡💻
